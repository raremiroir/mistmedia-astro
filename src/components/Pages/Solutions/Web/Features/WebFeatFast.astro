         A website needs to be fast. No doubt about it.<br/>
         According to studies, 25% of mobile visitors abandon the website if it takes longer than 4 seconds to load.<br/>
         A delay of 2 seconds achieves a rating of 13%, which is better, but far from optimal.<br/>
         <br/>
         Not only is fast page loading important for user experience, but it is also very important for the Google Ranking Factor.<br/>
         Basically, this means that the shorter your page loads, the higher it will get in Google's search results.

         It is recommended to aim for a load-time under half a second. <br/>
         Half a second is our minimum guarantee. We use a relatively young, but impressive javascript framework to write your website.<br/>
         <br/>
         This framework, Svelte, has been proven to be the fastest one out there as of yet.<br/>
         Combined with multiple tests using well-known and extensive tools, and optimizing every detail of your website, 
         we can create an extremely fast page load and thus a comfortable user experience.
